    <p class="Intro">Giorno Giovanna (ジョルノ・ジョバァーナ Joruno Jobāna) is the protagonist of Part 5 and the fifth JoJo of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series.
        Giorno is the illegitimate son of DIO, conceived with Jonathan Joestar's stolen body. He is introduced as Haruno Shiobana (汐華 初流乃). He speaks of his intention to join the powerful gang Passione and his dream of becoming a "Gang-Star".   
        Giorno's childhood was filled with unhappiness and loneliness due to bullies and the abuse by his stepfather. During his early childhood, he was initially cold and uncaring towards anyone and believed himself to be scum just for the way people treated him.
        Giorno is a natural-born Stand User wielding the life-giving Gold Experience in battle
        Giorno is a teenage boy of average height and slim yet muscular build, far smaller in stature than previous JoJos. He has golden hair of moderate length tied back in a short, braided tail, with three distinctive oversized curls arranged in a row over his forehead. His hair was originally black and unkempt but transformed upon awakening his Stand.</p>

    <p class="Intro">Gold Experience is one of the most versatile Stands in the series. It has the ability to create and manipulate life, which Giorno most often uses to produce plants and small animals. Both can be used for a variety of purposes ranging from disguise to tracking origins. As a short-ranged Power-type, it is also capable of unleashing a rapid barrage of punches, which Giorno uses almost exclusively with lethal intent.
        Since it can control life, it also has control over organs and blood, hence can heal others and himself using his stand. If giorno uses his ability on a living thing, their conscience goes berserk, and their senses are heighted in a massive scale. Gold Experience Requiem is obtained after Giorno pierces Gold Experience with the Stand-creating Arrow. It has the ability to turn the opponent's willpower and actions to zero. Whoever is killed by Requiem will also "have their death turned to zero," forcing them into a death loop for all eternity. Gold Experience was also pierced by the Arrow during Entering the Gang, Part 4 when Giorno is attacked by Black Sabbath , but it is unclear whether this is an oversight on the part of Araki, but the stand arrow the pierced gold experience was not a requiem arrow; therefore, Gold Experience could not achieve requiem.
